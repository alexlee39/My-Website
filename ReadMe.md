# My Website
This website is built to help me learn more about web-development and how to get better at it.

I would like to also document/record past projects I've worked on and also concepts I've learned throughout my life, from college to industry(hopefully).

Currently, its just a static website, but I may add some backend to this website. 

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
